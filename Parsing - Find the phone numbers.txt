Because the assignment was not explicit enough, I present you 2 variants of the solution:

1. The phone number simply exists within the given text (3 matches):

\(?07\d{2}\)?(-|..)\d{3}(-|..)?\d{3}

2. The phone number exists as a separate entity in the given text (i.e. it is wrapped in non-alphanumeric characters like whitespace, so it can be read separately at a glance) and its existance is not a coincidence (1 match):

\b\(?07\d{2}\)?(-|..)\d{3}(-|..)?\d{3}\b
